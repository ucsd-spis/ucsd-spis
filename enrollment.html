					<p>International students will need to obtain an I-20 (to apply for the F-1 visa) or DS-2019 (to apply for the J-1 visa) to attend SPIS. Once you get the admission notice from SPIS, submit your Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) if you haven't done so already. Wait 48 hours after submitting your SIR to login to the iPortal to request your I-20 or DS-2019. You may experience login issues if you do not wait 48 hours. If you have already been issued an I-20 and will need a new one with an earlier start date to attend the SPIS program, email iportal@ucsd.edu with "EARLY START DATE REQUEST - SPIS PROGRAM" in the subject line. Include your full name, PID and request for the early start date due to admission to the SPIS program in the email. You will need to create a new eship global order number if your I-20/DS-2019 needs to be resent. </p>
