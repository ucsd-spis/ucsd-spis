It opened my eyes to what I wanted to do in the field of computer science and I would definitely do this program again if I had the chance to."

All the people involved in this program - the students, mentors and teachers have made this program really fun. They have made me really feel UCSD is full of generous, kind people and i'm really looking forward to Fall Quarter. Thanks!"

You created such an amazing opportunity for me to grow and make connections with people. I feel much, much more prepared for the Fall quarter to start and am even excited for it. The people were my favorite part of SPIS. I will always say hello to my suite mates when I see them from now on and I am certain I will continue talking to more of them as the year goes on."
