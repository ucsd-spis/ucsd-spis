I would have never imagined how helpful and fun this summer program would be. The friends that I have made and the people I have met will probably last me through the rest of my college career. I would just like to thank everyone who has made this program possible."

Thanks guys. (^:"

However, doing SPIS is probably one of the greatest decisions I have made because it helped me transition into the Computer Science environment at UCSD. I also met a lot of cool and interesting people. I would definitely recommend SPIS to anyone interested in trying out Computer Science."
