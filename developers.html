  <div class="both">
    <p>
      The developers of the UCSD SPIS website are Anisha Atwal and Alise Bruevich.
      They both attended this program in the summer of 2019 before starting their freshmen year of college.
      For their final project during the project, they decided to recreate and improve the website for the SPIS program from scratch.
